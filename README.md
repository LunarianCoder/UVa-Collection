### UVa-Collection
The problem set for Basic Problems & Solving Algorithms Workshop can be found here. Each problem is provided with the problem description, a solution in java, and the input/output test case files. All solutions are proven for correctness via the UVa online judge. 

Remark that to have your program accepted, it must produce the same output as in the output test case file for the given input test case file. The time limit of every single problem is 3 seconds. Make sure your programs pass it.
 
## Selected Problem includes
1. #UVa 108 – Maximum Sum (DP+ Maximum Contiguous Sub-array) *hard
2. #UVa 495 – Fibonacci Freeze (DP+java.util.BigInteger) *easy
3. #UVa 506 – System Dependencies (Directed Graph+D&C) *normal
4. #UVa 523 – Minimum Transport Cost (Weighted Graph + Modified DP-SSSPs/APSPs) *very hard
5. #UVa 551 -  Nesting a Bunch of Brackets (Stack) *easy
